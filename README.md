# Simple Object Detection Code

In this repository, the simple object detection program is presented. This code can detect a person in a video that is recorded online by your webcam at the exact moment if you click on the person button in the window.

In this code, I use the yolo4 algorithm for this purpose that I got from pysource.com 

this yolo4 algorithm can be detected a lot of objects, that are specified in classes.txt, and the code can be expanded to detect those objects more easily by adding buttons.
